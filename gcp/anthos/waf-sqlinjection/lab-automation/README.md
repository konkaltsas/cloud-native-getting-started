## Prerequisites 
Please review the [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md) section prior to deploying the environment. It will assist in the creation of a dedicated GCP project to support this Terraform plan.  

## Environment Deployment and Destruction

### Updating Variables
**Copy** [terraform.tfvars.sample](terraform.tfvars.sample) to `terraform.tfvars` and customize to suit your environment. 

| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                          |

| zone                   | Specify a specific zone to deploy into to keep costs low. Specifying a region instead will create a regional cluster.                                |
| node\_type             | The node type for each GKE worker node                                                                                                               |
| max\_node\_count       | The maximum number of nodes to autoscale the GKE cluster to. The pool size has a default minimum of 1 node to keep costs low.                        |

| vpx\_cidr\_range       | A dedicated private IP range for the VPX 2nd nic to connect to which contains the VIPs.                                                              |
| vpx\_new\_password     | Set a password for the VPX. The GKE cluster will also obtain these values so that it can automatically configure the VPX.                            |
| ACM Repository Details | \-----                                                                                                                                               |

### Deployment Timing
While timing varies on a number of factors, with the [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md) already completed, the following approximate timing applies: 
- Infrastructure Creation - 10-15 minutes
- Infrastructure Destruction - 10-15 minutes

### Deployment Steps

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan 
terraform apply
```
![terraform-init](../assets/1-tf-init.gif)

![terraform-plan](../assets/2-tf-plan.gif)

![terraform-plan](../assets/3-tf-apply.gif)

**Important**
Please note that ADC VPX security features require ADC to be licensed. After ADC VPX is in place, please make sure to follow the steps required to apply your license in one of the various ways that are supported. For simplicity, for this demonstration we are [Using a standalone Citrix ADC VPX license](Licensing.md). For production deployment scenarios you are encouraged to apply different licensing schemes.
- [Licensing overview](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/licensing.html)
- [Citrix ADC pooled capacity](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-application-delivery-management-software/current-release/license-server/adc-pooled-capacity.html)

### Destroying the environment

```shell
terraform destroy
```

## Environment Validation
Verify the cluster configuration and VPX configuration once the environment has been deployed. 
- Cluster Login
  ```shell
  $ gcloud container clusters get-credentials ctx-lab-cluster --zone northamerica-northeast1-a --project $GCP_PROJECT
  Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
  kubeconfig entry generated for ctx-lab-cluster.
  ```

- Google Anthos Config Management Validation
  ```shell
  $ kubectl get pods -n config-management-system
  NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

  ```
